## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Although the challenge was pretty straightforward, I learnt the use of overflow property in CSS. A lot of time also went in figuring out the colors as all the colors are not mentioned in the style guide which are being used in the given design.


### Continued development

This project should have used the grid property but I got stuck in the middle, so I had to use Flexbox instead. Hence, I still need to get more comfortable with using Grid property.
